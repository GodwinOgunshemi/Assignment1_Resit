In the assignment brief I was asked to make a simple website but regardless of this I still made sure it was done to a good standard. I was required to demonstrate my programming skills using the languages HTML5 and CSS.

Before starting the website, I made sure I designed my website using wire frames and sketches which I will show in a separate document. This was done to make the production of this website much easier as I already had an idea of what the website would look like. To start the actual creation of the website I went on website and looked at a range of tutorials to give me an idea of how to make a HTML website in the end I only used one to get me started but by then I already had an idea of what to do, so making the main website only took 2 days. After that I then made the website look more professional by styling it in CSS. This required me to do further research about with the aim to familiarize myself with common CSS commands which I didn’t really find too difficult. With this knowledge, I could start styling my website to make it look more professional and much prettier. I made the sure the font (Arial) was consistent on all pages, as well as the font colour and word spacing. To save time I made the 4 pages identical at first so that the styling could be used on all pages, rather than styling each page individually. This also made the design of the website consistent. From there I then edited the data for each page according to the assignment brief. 

In conclusion, I was able to meet all the requirement that were laid out on the checklist except the following five items:
•	The Google Webfonts API has been used.
•	CSS Flexbox has been used in at least one place in your files (multiple columns on CV page).
•	Alternative text
•	Form fields have been included.
•	Use of some interactivity or CSS transition/transformation.
This assignment took about a week to complete and I made it without assistance or collaboration.
